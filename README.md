# ML_Hardness_pred_HEA

High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are new class of materials, which consist of 4 or more number of principle elements. They have gained significant traction in the past decade or two, due to their High performance characteristics under adverse environments. But exploring vast space of composition to estimate the mechanical properties(Here it is Hardness) is exhaustive in terms of time and resources. This work is intended to use Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the hardness of HEAs.
